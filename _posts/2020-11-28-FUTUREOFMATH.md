## Introduction
sometimes we ask our self some unfamiliar question about things we already know but still we don't have  all answers well that  day is Today so let do it ! My questions are what's mathematic ? how many type of mathematic ? and yes we use mathematic  in daily basis, I'm 100% sure that everyone in the world each day calculate somethings right ? as we try to imagine how our technology will be developed and how it's going to look like !? in this post we'll discuss how mathematic will look like in the future .
##  The Past and future
 mathematic is very important in our life to solve many problems . math is a powerful tool because its evolved all around us and this tool is key of advance of our civilization as Aristotle said :"The mathematical sciences particularly exhibit order, symmetry, and limitation; and these are the greatest forms of the beautiful." 
### Back To The Origins
To predict the future of mathematics we must go back in the time and see how's starts in the early ages and how the math looks like in different civilization, from counting to calculations to measurement without this fundamental knowledge people can't build house neither inherited or count  how much will be distributed . and from this basics questions  "how much ? how many ? how long? " math was born.
From understanding the fundamental knowledge of mathematics through the history we find that that tribes in Africa used to trade tobacco sticks for sheep the traders knew that 2 sticks equals to 1 sheep and 4 sticks equals to 2 sheep and from this we learnt  two times two equals four. and other tribes also knew to count only with 2 two numbers for example 2 plus 2plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2plus 2 plus 2plus 2 plus 2plus equals 10 and each place has his own way of counting all around the world.
Also the system of enumerations keep developing from old time till now. the primitive people used notches, sticks, stones then the Egyptians used symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1,000, ... 1,0000,000. while the Babylonians used two symbols only--cuneiform in the other hand Greeks used  alphabetical denotations, plus special symbols while Roman used Roman numerals, I,V,X,L,C,D,M..and Arabs used Ten special symbols for numbers until the Islamic  golden age and spread all around the world which what we using our  Modern time is a version of Arabian Ten special symbols for numbers.
### In between
 One of the famous devices that had been used for centuries is "Abacus" as Methods of ciphering . His first appearance was in the Sumer civilization period 2700â€“2300 BC that abacus kept getting developed in different time and conizations till our modern days is used as method of counting which there's many competitions all around the world its help children  and competitive players to have big imagination and mastering mind calculations either small or big numbers .
 today we have the modern abacus tomorrow we can have new generation of abacus a new form new concept and new methods or either i new algorithm for a new devices as we can see there a huge jump in the technology field and we are sure the future mathematic also will have a huge impact . in the future we will  numbers converted to colors ,shapes maybe a new advance understanding of our reality and talking about reality maybe in the future you can learn from the best professors in our history using virtual reality when can predict one exact thing but sure we can say maybe the ABACUS understanding will be changed for example the number 5 bead can be referred as color (red) while each other 4 beads referred to yellow orange blue and white . but blind people can have difficult to understand our reference then we can assignment to sound or taste of sense (a touch ) a shape or any things out of our imagination so we asked a friend (Leith) about this topic and he told us "that maybe the math we not change in the recent future but definitely the way of teaching will change he said math in the future will be the easiest subject and most understandable subject future student will understand due the effect of the technology there's more application mobile,web,games but not just that but also the future teachers will take innovative steps and new mentality of teaching the future generations ".
## General thoughts 
At end we all know that  our future will be different from our past because of our innovative actions to advance our civilization each day we lived and each time and we have numerous number of problems that need to be solve using mathematic and we pretty sure that our mathematicians will create new methods , new ways and solve all these problems  and I believe that mathematic is not away of counting but also is a language of the universe .
