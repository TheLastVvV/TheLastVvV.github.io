Back in 2009, I was very curious about how things work and always wanted as kid to make things done as fast as possible and by the influences of my surrending i learn how to build and fix basic computer problems as times goes i was intruduced to linux operation systems and i was hooked by Debian linux since then untill i find myself playing with backtrack 3 then Stuxnet worm Attack happend. that event was life changing and opens my eyes to the future and what i want to be so i started my self learning journey from understanding viruses to hacking computers and servers at end i choose to turn my hobby into a career and since 2016 i took it seriously in 2019 i started to study cyber secuirty engeening while working on my start-up buisness and in the same time maintaining a healthy family life style .
