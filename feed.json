Cyber security is combination of practice, strategies and policies that aim to protect systems, networks and data from malicious attacks and best way to protect these things is educate internet users to understand the attacks and risks and how take the necessary measures to defends their systems and electronic assets and in this report the users will have quick look at cyber security fields as part of our contribution to help making the internet a safe and secure place.Web securityWeb security field is incredibly famous branch of cyber security as we can see most internet users either own or visit websites and it’s important to know how threat actors attack these websites and how to protect them, this why we can showcase some famous OWASP top ten web application security vulnerabilities: SQL injection, Cross-site scripting, and Broken Access Control.SQL injectionSQL Injection: the threat attacker can inject SQL commands to manipulate or expose hidden data of the database and Theres many types of  SQL injection.  Attack :As we cans see below, we have a vulnerable website   that we will try SQL injection on itThe ways to check is by add a “ ‘ “ apostrophe at end of the id  ?id=1’ As we can see sometimes  you have some kind of error that indicates that there is a SQL error or just missing and broken things in the page We keep testing until the page return to normal states in this case in id 4 which means that there’s 4 columns in the database. Now we preform onion injection to check vulnerable columns in this case we have 3 and 4 that we can manipulate and get the data we wantA Simple SQL commands like database()  in vulnerable columns and we retrieved the database name Now we will retrieve username and password from the users table  using the vulnerable columns 3and4  Defend:Top 3 method of preventing SQL injection attacks “”  Prepared statement: “make sure that the parameters (i.e. inputs) passed into SQL statements are treated in a safe manner.” - Escaping Inputs: using the strings escaping   to avoid characters that could lead to a malicious SQL command. Example:    $firstname = $mysqli -&gt; real_escape_string($_POST['firstname']); $lastname = $mysqli -&gt; real_escape_string($_POST['lastname']); $age = $mysqli -&gt; real_escape_string($_POST['age']);         Sanitizing Inputs: the developers need to create a strong validations checker for all forms that helps to reject inputs that look suspicious automaticallyCross site-scriptingIs a vulnerability that allow the threat actor attack to inject malicious script in the vulnerable website which can lead to client-side attack in other meaning the threat actor can attack another user withing the vulnerable website Attack: In this case we will have a look of persistent cross site scripting of a vulnerable WordPress plugin that can lead to administrator and user’s session hijacking or phishing attack that can results of compromised the website. The threat actor can inject a malicious JavaScript into the registration form Which resulted in successful running the malicious JavaScript in admin panel of WordPress user. Defend:  Escape Dynamic Content: replacing significant characters (JavaScript) with the HTML entity encoding  Implementing  web application/server  firewalls like ( i.e. Akamai Edge, Cloudflare)  As normal user daily updating your plugins and remove inactive onesSecurity MisconfigurationAttack : From webserver Linux point of view , SUID means set user id , some files in Linux have some specific permission different from  r-w-x  this permissions are set by the owner of file . but in same binaries and files could be owned by root but other users are allowed to run it as result  sometimes in misconfiguration and unrestricted on authentication of the users. The threat actor can preform Privilege escalation from a normal user in system to root . As we can see  this system can be exploited by  runing sudo superuser command in ENV binary that results an access to the file system, escalating or maintain privileged access.Defend:  “Secure installation processes”  “A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all security.”  “An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the configurations”Software SecuritySoftware Security is important to to protect and secure softwares from threats and risksBuffer OverflowBuffer overflow:  occurs when a program tries to store more data in a temporary storage area than it can hold Attack (stack demo): in code above we can say user required to enter the name if the is match the name we stored it will create text file on the desktop (edited version of James Lyne)The C code have a variable char name have 16 bits what we cand see the that we exceeded the number of bits it starts over flow the second variable int which resulted in execution command if (namecheck) then created text file in the desktop Defend:  Better coding practices and security software implementation.  Non-executable stack:  configured the stack to not have any executable code.  Static Analysis:  analysis the source code from dangerous library calls ,strings and functions.IP SecurityIP: Internet Protocol address is a unique address assigned to a device on the local network or on the internetIP security: is security implantation which adds layers of encryption and authentication to the IP. Top IPsec benefits:  Secure routing  VPN over internet  Secure remote accessIP sec pros and cons: Pros:  Supplies confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity  Anon identity of the network  Secure network than without any security layersCons:  One problem can cause issues with full network  VPN gateways can be hacked  NAT and Firewall traversal are not easy to solveEmail-SecurityEmail security is particularly important because of the sensitive information that countians but also the wide range if usage of emails is part of our daily checkup routine that why we need to learn how to email security works and how we need to do to be safe. Most of emails gateways come with some specific security layers like:  Anti-virus Protection  Data Encryption  Spam filteringBut all these measures are not enough we need to make sure we are doing a secure login, having strong password, not opening random and spam emails, or downloading the attachments. As for companies they need to create a program with new policies and rules that change Frequently change password, and avoid sharing sensitive information and use of company emails without a secure connections like VPN.ConclusionAt end the users of internet should learn and understand cyber security and also security expert should teach and contribute to the community and encourage the new comers and curious people because security is not about secure coding but also a life style, information security is wide range of fields and topic can be presented in different ways at end is to archive one goal a secure and safe cyberspace for everyone.Reference:https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_mysqli_real_escape_string.asphttps://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.htmlhttps://redtiger.labs.overthewire.org/https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/env/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ip-security-ipsec/https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cis788-97/ftp/ip_security/index.htmlhttps://forum.huawei.com/enterprise/en/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-ipsec/thread/567725-867https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15536https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15536",
